## Folder Structure

The project that has been submitted with a score of 125 is located in the `libft_125_submitted` folder. The ongoing development of other projects is located in the `new_libft` folder.

Please note that the functions ending with `_np` inside the `new_libft` folder are NULL protected, providing additional safety measures.

The `extra` folder contains content related to development of my own libft test (currently under development). This folder may include additional test files, scripts, or other resources used in the testing process.

## Installation

To install Libft, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/libft.git
```

Then, navigate to the libft directory and run the `make` command:

```bash
cd libft
make
```

This will compile the library and create a `libft.a` file.

## Usage

To use Libft in your C projects, include the `libft.h` header file at the top of your C files:

```c
#include "libft.h"
```

Then, when compiling your project, link the `libft.a` file:

```bash
gcc -L. -lft yourfile.c -o yourprogram
```

## Testing

To thoroughly test your Libft implementation, it is recommended to combine the use of two different testers:

1. [Supreme Tester Libft](https://github.com/FranFrau/Supreme-Tester-Libft): This tester includes a wide range of test cases to assess the correctness and performance of your Libft functions. Please follow the instructions provided in the Supreme Tester Libft repository to run the tests effectively. Here are the installation instructions:

   WARNING: This script uses some testers made by students of the 42 network. Be aware and test it on your own, as we never know if the moulinette has been updated. See if and where it fails, and understand what the testers tell you.

   Installation:
   - The folder name must be called "libft".
   - Run `sh tester.sh` to execute the tests.
   - Edit the 8th row in `libft-war-machine/my_config.sh` file to specify the correct path to your Libft directory.

   Testers:
   - [y3ll0w42](https://github.com/y3ll0w42/libft-war-machine)
   - [jtoty](https://github.com/jtoty/Libftest.git)
   - [Tripouille](https://github.com/Tripouille/libftTester.git)
   - [alelievr](https://github.com/alelievr/libft-unit-test.git)
   - [adrossig](https://github.com/adrossig/libft_tester.git)

2. [libft-tester-tokyo](https://github.com/usatie/libft-tester-tokyo): This tester is specifically designed for the Libft project and includes additional test cases to validate your implementation. Refer to the instructions in the libft-tester-tokyo repository to execute the tests accurately. Here are the usage instructions:

   Clone this repository to the root directory of your Libft repository:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/libft/directory
   git clone https://github.com/usatie/libft-tester-tokyo.git
   cd libft-tester-tokyo
   ```

   Run the following commands to test your Libft functions:

   ```bash
   make all             # Test mandatory functions
   make libft-00        # Test Libft-00 ~ Libft-02 (change part number as per your project)
   make bonus           # Test bonus functions
   make strlen          # Test individual function (e.g., strlen)
   make norm            # Run Norminette & coding rules
   ```

   Please note that you can add more test cases and contribute to the tester by sending issues/PRs.

By combining these two testers, you can ensure comprehensive testing of your Libft library.
